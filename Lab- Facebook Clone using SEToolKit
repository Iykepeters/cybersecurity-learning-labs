Objective

In this lab, I tried to clone facebook's login page and sniff login credentials using SEToolKit.

This output was generated on my listening server, as I tried the clone.

[*] Cloning the website: https://login.facebook.com/login.php [*] This could take a little bit...
The best way to use this attack is if username and password form fields are available. Regardless, 
this captures all POSTs on a website. [*] The Social-Engineer Toolkit Credential Harvester Attack [*] 
Credential Harvester is running on port 80 [*] Information will be displayed to you as it arrives below:


My facebook clone was successful, but I noticed quite some clear distinctions between facebook's original login page and my cloned  page. (See the next commit for snapshots)


## Part 2 of the lab involved sniffing login credentials of a user on my listening server.

This part of my lab experiment failed, and returned Facebook's telemetry / anti-abuse data, which includes:

Session IDs

Device/browser fingerprints

Behavioral signals

Bot-detection metrics

Integrity checks

Facebook sends this before credentials are even processed. All thanks to facebook's robust security architecture. 


## Below are the reasons why this attempt failed:

1.Facebook is a hardened target. The real login logic is handled by dynamic JS. Credentials are processed client-side, then sent in encrypted requests my cloned page couldn't replicate this logic.

2.My cloned page, wasn't unable to save cookies, which means tokens fail integrity checks and so it couldn't validate my login attempt.

3.Facebook security architecture verifies Domain, TLS fingerprint, JS integrity, Request origin.

And maybe finally,

The SEToolKit is a legacy tool and works majorly on legacy apps, poorly protected internal portals and training labs.

Disclaimer!

Using SET against real services or real users without permission is illegal in most jurisdictions (including Nigeria).


## Conclusion

I think if people updated their softwares more, they'd be more swift in spotting cloned sites. This is beacuse cloned sites are mostly legacy versions.

A hit, using some tools doesn't neccessarily equate to a compromise.

A good software design, would consist of a robust security architecture.

Facebook's mechanism of encryption of credentials should be applauded.


## Reflective questions from a defender’s view

“How does Facebook prevent this?”

“What indicators would a SOC see to spot a credential theft attempt?”

“How would I detect this on my own network?”
