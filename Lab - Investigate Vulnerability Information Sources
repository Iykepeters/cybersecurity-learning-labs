In this lab, i'm using multiple helpful sources to further investigate vulnerabilities.

Background / Scenario
In a previous lab, I found several vulnerabilities after scanning a target system. 
I will now use several widely available sources to dig deeper into the details of the vulnerabilities. 
I will map and investigate the vulnerabilities to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list, the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), the NIST National Vulnerability Database, and the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

Required Resources
Computer with internet connection


Step 1: Explore CVE.

Launch the CVE website and navigate to www.cve.org.
Read the overview of the CVE program.
Select About > Overview in the menu.
View the CVE Program Overview video.
Review the available Podcasts for more detailed information about the CVE program.

Step 2: Use the CVE program to gather information about vulnerabilities.
In an earlier lab, I scanned a target system for vulnerabilities. The list of vulnerabilities found returned the following six CVEs:

CVE-2021-41617
CVE-2020-14145
CVE-2019-16905
CVE-2019-6111
CVE-2019-6110
CVE-2019-6109

So, I scanned the CVE database to gather more information about the vulnerablities http://www.cve.org/


Part 2
In the second part of the lab I explored the Common Weakness Enumeration website,  https://cwe.mitre.org.
I also researched the CWE numbers assoiciated with the CVE's from part 1


Part 3
I Investigated National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Vulnerability Resources, exploring the national vulnerability database https://www.nist.gov.
discovering the relationship between NVD's and CVE's. The NVD performs analysis on CVEs that are published in the CVE dictionary. NVD staff analyze CVEs and provide additional details.

Part 4: 
I Researched Vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)  https://first.org/cvss

Conclusion
CVE lists vulnerabilities that have been discovered, CWE classifies these vulnerabilities, NVD provides details, and CVSS provides severity ratings.
