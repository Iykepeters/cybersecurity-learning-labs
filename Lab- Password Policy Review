Security Assessment: Password Policy Review

Target Environment
Domain: METASPLOITABLE
Component: Windows Active Directory Password Policy
Assessment Type: Configuration & Policy Review
Risk Level: Critical


1️⃣ Comparison: Current   VS       Hardened Windows AD Policy

Password Policy Comparison Table

Control Area	              METASPLOITABLE (Observed)	          Hardened Windows AD (Best Practice)

Minimum password length	    5 characters	                      ≥ 12–14 characters
Password complexity	        Disabled	                          Enabled (upper, lower, number, symbol)
Password history	          None	                              ≥ 24 remembered passwords
Maximum password age	      Not set (never expires)	            ≤ 90 days
Minimum password age	      None	                              ≥ 1 day
Account lockout threshold	  None (disabled)	                    3–5 failed attempts
Lockout duration	          Configured but unused             	15–30 minutes
Anonymous policy access   	Allowed                           	Denied by default



🔴 Key Gaps Identified

Unlimited authentication attempts

Extremely weak password requirements

No resistance to brute force or password spraying

Excessive information disclosure via SMB

In a real enterprise, this configuration would not pass any security audit.




2️⃣ MITRE ATT&CK Mapping (Credential Access)

Primary Tactic
TA0006 – Credential Access

The tested environment is subject to the followig relevant techniques
🔹 T1110 – Brute Force

Under the following reasons:

1. No account lockout threshold
2. Short minimum password length
3. No password complexity

other techniques:
T1110.001 – Password Guessing
T1110.003 – Password Spraying

Attackers can attempt unlimited passwords without detection or lockout.


🔹 T1003 – OS Credential Dumping (Indirect Enablement)
Under the following rerasons:

1. Weak passwords increase success of credential harvesting
2. Enables lateral movement after one credential is obtained


🔹 T1555 – Credentials from Password Stores (Contextual)
Under the following reasons:

1. Long-lived passwords increase value of stolen credentials

2. No forced rotation limits exposure window

MITRE Summary
Weak password policy directly enables credential-based attacks, reducing attacker cost and increasing success probability.

CIS Control ID	           Description	                                          Status
1.1.1	                     Ensure password history is enforced	                  ❌ Not enforced
1.1.2	                     Ensure maximum password age is set	                    ❌ Not set
1.1.3	                     Ensure minimum password age is set	                    ❌ Not set
1.1.4	                     Ensure minimum password length ≥ 14	                  ❌ 5 characters
1.1.5                      Ensure password complexity is enabled	                ❌ Disabled
1.2.1	                     Ensure account lockout threshold is configured	        ❌ Disabled
1.2.2	                     Ensure account lockout duration is configured	        ⚠️ Ineffective
2.3.11	                   Restrict anonymous access to security info	            ❌ Allowed


CIS Impact Statement
The system fails multiple foundational identity security controls, significantly increasing the likelihood of credential compromise.





4️⃣ Formal Finding Documentation

📄 Finding Title
Weak Password Policy Enables Credential Attacks

Severity: Critical

Description
The Active Directory domain password policy is severely misconfigured. Password complexity is disabled, minimum password length is set to 5 characters, password expiration is not enforced, and account lockout thresholds are disabled. Additionally, password policy information is accessible through unauthenticated or low-privileged SMB enumeration.

Risk:
These weaknesses allow attackers to:

1.Perform unlimited brute-force attacks
2.Conduct effective password spraying
3.Reuse compromised credentials indefinitely
4.Escalate privileges and move laterally across the domain
5.This significantly lowers the effort required for full domain compromise.


Recommendation:

1.Enforce minimum password length of 14 characters
2.Enable password complexity requirements
3.Configure password history (≥ 24)
4.Set password expiration to ≤ 90 days
5.Enable account lockout after 5 failed attempts
6.Restrict anonymous SMB enumeration
7.Implement MFA for privileged accounts

Business Impact
Failure to remediate may result in:

1.Credential theft
2.Unauthorized access
3.Data breaches
4.Full domain compromise
