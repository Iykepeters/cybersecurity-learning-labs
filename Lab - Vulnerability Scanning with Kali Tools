## Objectives

In this lab, i explored network vulnerability scanning tools and used them to perform a vulnerability scan on a target host.

I performed the network scans with Nmap.
I also tried using Greenbone Vulnerability Management to perform a vulnerability scan.


## Procedure
 Run a Nmap Scan on a Target Computer
 ping -c5 <target host>

Identify open ports and services.
nmap -sV <target host>

Identify the operating system running on the target computer using the nmap -O command.
 sudo nmap -O <target host>

Use the Nmap Vulners script to scan for vulnerabilities.
nmap -sV --script vulners --script-args mincvss=4 <target host>

Identify what service is running in the host and the expoitable vulnerabilities associated with it.

Use the National Vulnerability Database at NIST to learn more about the identified vulnerability and how it can be exploited.


Part 2: Use GVM to Scan for Vulnerabilities

GVM is part of the Open Source Vulnerability Management suite of products produced by Greenbone Networks GmbH. 
The GVM scanner is one of the most widely used open-source vulnerability scanners. Unlike Nmap, GVM uses a graphical user interface to initiate scans and report vulnerability scan results.

## Procedure

Step 1: Verify the GVM Product Installation.
sudo gvm-check-setup

Step 2: Open the GVM Scanner GUI.
sudo gvm-start

Step 3: Scan the Target Host for Vulnerabilities
In this step you will scan the same target computer for vulnerabilities that you did with the earlier Nmap scan.

In the IP address or hostname box, enter the IP address if the target hostClick the Start Scan button at the bottom of the screen. The scan will take a few minutes, so wait for it to complete. The status and percent complete are displayed on the screen. The scan will be finished when the status changes to Done.
Click the number under the Reports column while the scanning is running for the associated scan.
When the scan is complete, click the timestamp under the Date column to view the report detail.
The CVEs associated with the vulnerabilities that were found on the host can be viewed by clicking the CVEs tab. Explore the other tabs.
Download the report by clicking the Download Filtered Report button from the menu in the upper left of the report page. It has a downward-pointing arrow icon. In the settings box, choose to download the report in PDF format. After a brief delay, the PDF file should open in your browser.

Step 4: Clean Up
When you are done with GVM services, use the following command to stop GVM.
 sudo gvm-stop

## Observation
Experienced Linux users may want to use Nmap commands for initial scans, but GVM GUI interface is more intuitive.
New exploits and vulnerabilities are discovered every day. Not all systems are patched and up-to-date on security. Therefore, it is necessary to keep both new and older CVEs in the database.
