Business logic flaws enable an attacker to use legitimate transactions and flows of an application in a way that results in a negative behavior or outcome. 
Most common business logic problems are different from the typical security vulnerabilities in an application (such as XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection). 
A challenge with business logic flaws is that they can’t typically be found by using scanners or other similar tools.


The likelihood of business logic flaws being exploited by threat actors depends on many circumstances. However, such exploits can have serious consequences. 
Data validation and use of a detailed threat model can help prevent and mitigate the effects of business logic flaws. 
OWASP offers recommendations on how to test and protect against business logic attacks at https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/10-Business_Logic_Testing/01-Test_Business_Logic_Data_Validation.

MITRE has assigned Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) ID 840 (CWE-840) to business logic errors.

examples of business logic flaws including the following:

Unverified ownership
Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel
Authorization bypass through user-controlled key
Weak password recovery mechanism for forgotten password
Incorrect ownership assignment
Allocation of resources without limits or throttling
Premature release of resource during expected lifetime
Improper enforcement of a single, unique action
Improper enforcement of a behavioral workflow
