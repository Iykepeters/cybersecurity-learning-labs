# cybersecurity-learning-labs
This repository is a documentation of my cybersecurity learning path and hands-on lab practices, focusing on ethical security research, network analysis, and defensive thinking.

the goal is to build real-world security intuition while respecting legal and ethical boundaries.

 ## Focus Areas
- Network reconnaissance & enumeration
- Exposure analysis using public intelligence
- Protocol and traffic analysis
- Security misconfiguration awareness
- Blue-team defensive recommendations

## Tools & Technologies
- Packet tracer
- Nmap
- Shodan
- Scapy
- Wireshark
- Kali Linux networking & pentesting tools
- Bash / Python (when applicable)

  All activities documented here:
- Are for educational purposes only
- Use authorized labs or publicly available data
- Do **not** involve exploitation of live systems

This repo is updated incrementally as learning progresses.  
Each lab reflects **what was tested, observed, and learned**, not just tool output.
