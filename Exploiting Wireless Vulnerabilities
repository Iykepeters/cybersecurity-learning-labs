Rogue Access Points
One of the most simplistic wireless attacks involves an attacker installing a rogue AP in a network to fool users to connect to that AP. 
Basically, the attacker can use that rogue AP to create a backdoor and obtain access to the network and its systems

Evil Twin Attacks
In an evil twin attack, the attacker creates a rogue access point and configures it exactly the same as the existing corporate network.
the attacker uses DNS spoofing to redirect the victim to a cloned captive portal or a website. When users are logged on to the evil twin, a hacker can easily inject a spoofed DNS record into the DNS cache, changing the DNS record for all users on the fake network. 
Any user who logs in to the evil twin will be redirected by the spoofed DNS record injected into the cache. 
An attacker who performs a DNS cache poisoning attack wants to get the DNS cache to accept a spoofed record.
Some ways to defend against DNS spoofing are using packet filtering, cryptographic protocols, and spoofing detection features provided by modern wireless implementations.

Captive portals are web portals that are typically used in wireless networks in public places such as airports and coffee shops. T
hey are typically used to authenticate users or to simply display terms and conditions that apply to users when they are using the wireless network. 
The user can simply click Accept to agree to the terms and conditions. In some cases, the user is asked to view an advertisement, provide an email address, or perform some other required action.
Attackers can impersonate captive portals to perform social engineering attacks or steal sensitive information from users.

Disassociation (or Deauthentication) Attacks
An attacker can cause legitimate wireless clients to deauthenticate from legitimate wireless APs or wireless routers to either perform a DoS condition or to make those clients connect to an evil twin. 
This type of attack is also known as a disassociation attack because the attacker disassociates (tries to disconnect) the user from the authenticating wireless AP and then carries out another attack to obtain the user’s valid credentials.
Basically, the attacker disconnects the user from a legitimate wifi network and tries to lure him to connect to his own network in other to gain network credentials from the user.

A service set identifier (SSID) is the name or identifier associated with an 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN). SSID names are included in plaintext in many wireless packets and beacons. 
A wireless client needs to know the SSID in order to associate with a wireless AP. It is possible to configure wireless passive tools like Kismet or KisMAC to listen to and capture SSIDs and any other wireless network traffic. In addition, tools such as Airmon-ng (which is part of the Aircrack-ng suite) can perform this reconnaissance. 
The Aircrack-ng suite of tools can be downloaded from https://www.aircrack-ng.org.

The 802.11w standard defines the Management Frame Protection (MFP) feature. MFP protects wireless devices against spoofed management frames from other wireless devices that might otherwise deauthenticate a valid user session. 
In other words, MFP helps defend against deauthentication attacks. MFP is negotiated between the wireless client (supplicant) and the wireless infrastructure device (AP, wireless router, and so on)

Wireless Signal Jamming and Interference
The purpose of jamming wireless signals or causing wireless network interference is to create a full or partial DoS condition in the wireless network. 
Such a condition, if successful, is very disruptive. Most modern wireless implementations provide built-in features that can help immediately detect such attacks. 
In order to jam a Wi-Fi signal or any other type of radio communication, an attacker basically generates random noise on the frequencies that wireless networks use.
With the appropriate tools and wireless adapters that support packet injection, an attacker can cause legitimate clients to disconnect from wireless infrastructure devices.

War Driving
War driving is a method attackers use to find wireless access points wherever they might be. By just driving (or walking) around, an attacker can obtain a significant amount of information over a very short period of time. 
Another similar attack is war flying, which involves using a portable computer or other mobile device to search for wireless networks from an aircraft, such as a drone or another unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

 A popular site among war drivers is WiGLE (https://wigle.net). The site allows users to detect Wi-Fi networks and upload information about the networks by using a mobile app.


5.2.8 Initialization Vector (IV) Attacks and Unsecured Wireless Protocols
The goal of the attacker is to obtain a lot of information about the plaintext of a single packet and generate another encryption key that can then be used to decrypt other packets using the same IV. WEP is susceptible to many different attacks, including IV attacks.

An attacker can also use the Aircrack-ng set of tools to crack (recover) the WEP PSK. 
To perform this attack using the Aircrack-ng suite, an attacker first launches Airmon-ng

Example 5-16 - Using Airmon-ng to Monitor a Wireless Network

root@kali# airmon-ng start wlan0 11 
In Example, 5-16 the wireless interface is wlan0, and the selected wireless channel is 11. Now the attacker wants to listen to all communications directed to the BSSID 08:02:8E:D3:88:82, as shown in Example 5-17. The command in Example 5-17 writes all the traffic to a capture file called omar_capture.cap. The attacker only has to specify the prefix for the capture file.

Example 5-17 - Using Airodump-ng to Listen to All Traffic to the BSSID 08:02:8E:D3:88:82

root@kali# airodump-ng -c 11 --bssid 08:02:8E:D3:88:82 -w omar_capture wlan0
The attacker can use Aireplay-ng to listen for ARP requests and then replay, or inject, them back into the wireless network, as shown in Example 5-18.

Example 5-18 - Using Aireplay-ng to Inject ARP Packets

root@kali# aireplay-ng -3 -b 08:02:8E:D3:88:82 -h 00:0F:B5:88:AC:82 wlan0
The attacker can use Aircrack-ng to crack the WEP PSK, as demonstrated in Example 5-19.

Example 5-19 - Using Aircrack-ng to Crack the WEP PSK

root@kali# aircrack-ng -b 08:02:8E:D3:88:82 omar_capture.cap
After Aircrack-ng cracks (recovers) the WEP PSK, the output in Example 5-20 is displayed. The cracked (recovered) WEP PSK is shown in the highlighted line.

Attacks Against WPA

WPA and WPA version 2 (WPA2) are susceptible to different vulnerabilities. WPA version 3 (WPA3) addresses all the vulnerabilities to which WPA and WPA2 are susceptible, and many wireless professionals recommend WPA3 to organizations and individuals.

All versions of WPA support different authentication methods, including PSK. WPA is not susceptible to the IV attacks that affect WEP; however, it is possible to capture the WPA four-way handshake between a client and a wireless infrastructure device and then brute-force the WPA PSK.
